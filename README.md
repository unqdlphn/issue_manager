# Issue Manager 1.0

![Issue Manager Header](images/issue_manager_header.png)

Issue Manager is a simple command-line application for managing issues. It allows you to add, list, edit, archive, delete, and search for issues. The application uses SQLite for data storage and supports exporting issues to CSV files.

## Features

### 1.0

- **Add Issue**: Add a new issue with a title, description, and tags.
- **List Current Issues**: List all current (non-archived) issues.
- **Edit Issue**: Edit the details of an existing issue.
- **Archive Issue**: Archive a resolved issue.
- **List Archived Issues**: List all archived issues.
- **Export All Issues to CSV**: Export all issues to a CSV file.
- **Search Issues**: Search for issues based on a search term.
- **Delete Issue**: Delete an open issue.

### 1.1

- **Confirmation Prompts**: Added confirmation prompts for adding, editing, archiving, and deleting issues.
- **Limit on Number of Issues**: Limited the number of current issues to 7 to motivate users to resolve issues.
- **Enhanced Input Editing**: Enabled arrow keys and delete buttons while entering information using the `readline` module.
- **Fixed Edit Issue Bug**: Fixed a bug where editing an issue created a new issue instead of updating the existing one.
- **Database Integration**: Replaced JSON data storage with SQLite database for better performance and scalability.

## Main Feature

### SQite Enhancements

1. Error Handling: Implement try-except blocks to handle potential database errors (e.g., connection issues, invalid SQL queries).
2. Data Types: Use appropriate SQLite3 data types (`TEXT`, `INTEGER`, `REAL`, `BLOB`, etc.) for the columns.
3. Security: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
4. Performance: Optimize the queries and use indexes for faster data retrieval.
5. Database Interaction: Include methods for interacting with the database, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
6. Validation: Include validation logic to ensure that the data being stored meets certain criteria.
7. Abstraction: Provide an abstraction layer between the database and the application logic, making it easier to manage and manipulate data.
8. Documentation: Include comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each method and how to use them.
